    <p>This spicy pasta dish is a favorite of ours. It might seem a little complicated, 
        but you can definitely do it. We make it spicy, so if your
         heat tolerance is lower, just use a little less of the 
         spice and youâ€™ll be alright. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>2 Andouille sausages, cut into slices</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. of butter, broken down into 1 tbsp. and 3 tbsp. chunks</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. flour and 1 additional tbsp. Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>12 ounces Farfalle pasta</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the cut chicken breasts and place them in a large mixing bowl with
            the kosher salt and Cajun seasoning. Let it sit for 20-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Spray a high-walled cooking pan with cooking spray and place over medium heat. 
            When the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook until done. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Andouille sausage to the pan. Cook for about three minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile: cook the Farfalle according to the package directions.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp. of butter to the pan and then add the finely diced onions. Cook for 
            three to four minutes, until the onions are browned. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the remaining butter to the pan and melt it over medium-high heat. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the butter is completely melted, add the flour and additional Cajun seasoning
            to the pan. Whisk <em>vigorously</em> and <em>continuously</em> until the butter-flour mix is 
            thick and gooey. Whisking continuously, add the chicken broth to the pan and stir until the mixture is incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can slow down on the whisking now. Add the heavy cream to the sauce and stir until it is incorporated. Add the mushrooms and turn 
            the heat to low. Let the mushrooms sit in the sauce for a few minutes as it cooks. 
            Add the chicken and sausage to the sauce. Stir.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste-test your sauce: it should be fairly spicy, but you can add more Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Once the sauce is to your liking, add the cooked farfalle to the sauce. Stir well and serve immediately! This spicy dish goes well with a 
            Caesar salad or some garlic toast. 
        </li>
